# Inventory plugin for Craft CMS 4

**Take stock of how your fields are being used.**

---

>"Am I using this field? _Where_ am I using this field?"

You no longer have to wonder... Inventory will show you exactly where your fields appear!

## ‚≠êÔ∏è INVENTORY HAS BEEN RETIRED ‚≠êÔ∏è

Inventory will not be ported to Craft 5, because it is no longer necessary!

Craft's new native field management UX replaces all functionality that Inventory provided prior to Craft 5. üëè

## How to Install

</p>

## Managing the Field Inventory

After determining how your fields are being used, it's possible to then **delete** or **edit** those fields. Or you can "Edit layout" to change how (or whether) the field appears in that layout.
