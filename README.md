# Inventory plugin for Craft CMS

**Take stock of how your fields are being used.**

>"Am I using this field? _Where_ am I using this field?"

You no longer have to wonder... Inventory will show you exactly where your fields appear!

## How to Install

See official installation instructions on the [Craft CMS Plugin Store...](https://plugins.craftcms.com/inventory)

## Viewing the Field Inventory

Once the plugin is installed, view your field inventory by going to:

    <strong>Utilities > Field Inventory</strong>

</p>

## Managing the Field Inventory

After determining how your fields are being used, it's possible to then **delete** or **edit** those fields. Or you can "Edit layout" to change how (or whether) the field appears in that layout.
